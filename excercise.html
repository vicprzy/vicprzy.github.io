    <div class = "beginning"><h1>  Excercise  </h1></div>
    <p>Whenever we see workouts online or recommended from friends, we may start picking up these routines. Yet what many people don't know is that you have to change your workouts based on your different phases due to the different occurences in each phase. Although you should listen to your body at all times, here are some recommended exercises per each phase. </p> 
    <div class = "thebodyneedslove"><h3>Follicular Phase Exercises</h3></div>
    <p>With the rise of energy levels, many people start to feel ambitious. As a way to feed that determination, opt in to try some High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), strength training (boxing or lifting weights) and cardio exercises such as cycling or jogging. This will be very satisfactory espically when met with completed goals.</p>
    <br>

    <div class = "thebodyneedslove"><h3>Ovulation Phases Exercises</h3></div>
    <p>Similar to the Follicular phase, energy levels are extremely high, so it's encouraged to continue on with the HIIT trainings, strength trainings, as well as cardio exercises. Nonetheless it's recommended to switch up the workouts by substituting one workout for another or increasing the mass of weights to increase the resistance and satisfy the high energy. </p>
    <br>

    <div class = "thebodyneedslove"><h3>Luteal Phases Exercises</h3></div>
    <p>As the energy starts to wean off due to the increase of progesterone, it is recognized that exercises need to slow down on intensity. Instead of doing the high energy training that has been mentioned from the past two phases, it's time to switch onto low to moderate exercises such as yoga, swimming, or pilates. This will help keep you moving and not drain any more energy that comes on top of the changes during the Luteal phase. </p>
    <br>

    <div class = "thebodyneedslove"><h3>Menstration Phases Exercises</h3></div>
    <p>Once the period starts, it's vital to listen to your body. If you are up to task of working out, it is said to do low energy exercises such as long walks, stretches, or bike rides to help keep your body moving, but recovering at the same time. These low intense workouts may also help with decreasing dysmenorrhea (period pain) overtime which may be beneficial to those with intense cramps and want to work on relief. </p>
