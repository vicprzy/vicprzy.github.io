    <div class = "tabs"><h3>4 Phases of a Menstral Cycle</h3></div>
    <div class= "alltoknow"><p>In the average 28 days cycle, a woman will face 4 phases in a cycle continously after getting her first period. Although the amount of days in each phase varies from person to person, the period is a signal on how the body is doing, and it is important to track the days and know what is happening during each phase.</p></div>

    <!-- the stages -->
    <div class = "tabs"><h3>Phase 1: Follicular </h3></div>
    <div class= "alltoknow"><p>Days: Starts on the first day of the period and ends around 13-15 days later when ovulation starts</p>
    <p>Hormones present: Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), raised Estrogen levels</p>
    <p>What is happening: The brain has received a signal from FSH for the uterus to start producing follicles (little pouches where premature eggs go). While this is happening, estrogen has signalled to the body that the uterus needs to start preparing to form a blood lining where one matured egg will end up.</p>
    <p>How you may feel: More energized, higher energy levels, more motivation, and a want to socialize.</p></div>
    <br>
    
    <div class = "tabs"><h3>Phase 2: Ovulation </h3></div>
    <div class= "alltoknow"><p>Days: Around 1 day </p>
    <p>Hormones present: Luteinizing hormone (LH), raised Estrogen levels</p>
    <p>What is happening: Once the follicles are mature, only 1 is chosen to go down the fallopian tubes. In the 24 hours that an egg is travelling down the fallopian tubes, this is the only time where pregnancy can occur. If an egg hasn't been fertilized, it disolves or dies. Sometimes if body temperature is higher, it may be a sign of ovulation!</p>
    <p>How you may feel: More confidence and more ambitious.</p></div>
    <br>
    
    <div class = "tabs"><h3>Phase 3: Luteal </h3></div>
      <div class= "alltoknow"><p>Days: About 13 days following Ovulation</p>
    <p>Hormones present: Progesterone, Oestrogen</p>
    <p>What is happening: As mentioned before, the period lining has been signalled to form. With the help of progesterone, the lining is being built and thickened for the potential support of a pregnancy. If the egg is fertilized, more progesterone is produced, and nothing is shed due to supporting the pregnancy that will occur. If the egg isn't fertilized, the Menstrual phase begins.</p>
    <p>How you may feel: Lowered energy levels and less motivation</p></div>
    <br>
    
    <div class = "tabs"><h3>Phase 4: Menstrual </h3></div>
      <div class= "alltoknow"><p>Days: The 4-8 days that is known as the period!</p>
    <p>Hormones present: Estrogen levels drop and Progesterone levels drop</p>
    <p>What is happening: Due to the occurence of no fertilization in the egg, the lining of the uterus is shed. It is most commonly comprised of blood and tissue that decreases it's flow rate over time. Once the lining is shed, the process starts all over again at the Follicular phase! </p>
    <p>How you may feel: Low energy levels, cramps, bloating, headaches, and moodswings. BUT something that is extremely important is <i>SELF CARE!</i> It is necessary to take care of oneself and listen to what the body is requiring at all times. If the body says it needs rest, take a nap. If the body is craving food, eat what is desired. The more the body is listened to, the easier the symptoms pass.</p></div>
